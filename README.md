bio: |
  I thrive where code meets infrastructure.  
  My journey began with fixing systems, but evolved into building them better—  
  bridging reliability, automation, and innovation.

  Experienced in diagnosing and resolving complex system, network, and storage challenges  
  across enterprise environments, always keeping performance, uptime, and trust at the core.

  Passionate about open source, cloud infrastructure, and the quiet art of making technology work seamlessly.  
  For me, DevOps isn’t just about pipelines or tools—it’s about people, process, and purpose.
