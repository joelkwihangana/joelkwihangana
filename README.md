I am a Technical Support Engineer with a strong foundation in Software Engineering and a growing focus on DevOps practices. I bring deep expertise in Cloud Infrastructure, Endpoint Security, AI integration, and IT Systems Administration, with a passion for automation and scalable solutions.

I specialize in resolving complex issues across enterprise environments while automating repetitive tasks using Python and Bash to drive efficiency and scale.

Proven track record supporting platforms like Symantec CloudSOC/CASB and VMware Carbon Black EDR, with a strong focus on root cause analysis, system optimization, and cross-functional collaboration.

Currently advancing my skills in DevOps, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. 

I follow the Pareto Principle—automating the 20% of tasks that create 80% of the workload—to deliver smarter, faster, and more secure operations.

I am an engineer who transforms challenges and rejection into growth opportunities, constantly evolving to deliver reliable, scalable solutions in dynamic environments.
