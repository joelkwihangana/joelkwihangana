< HelloWorld />

I am a Technical Application Engineer who lives at the intersection of software development, automation, and operations. 
With a background in application support and enterprise Linux environments, I have developed a deep passion for building systems that are reliable, secure, and beautifully automated.

My experience spans Red Hat, Ubuntu, windows, Kubernetes, and virtualization technologies, where I have helped global customers diagnose and resolve complex infrastructure issues while maintaining high performance and uptime.

I see DevOps not just as a set of tools, but as a philosophy of collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation. 
My goal is to bridge code and infrastructure to create solutions that evolve, adapt, and perform with precision.
