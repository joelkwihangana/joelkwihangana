< HelloWorld />
I am a full-stack AI DevOps engineer. I build systems that matter. I create, not consume. My discomfort is growth.

I see DevOps not just as a set of tools, but as a philosophy of collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation. 

My goal is to bridge code and infrastructure to create solutions that evolve, adapt, and perform with precision.
